# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
   My initial thoughts about the pyton programming language is that it is much more simple and short compared to other programming languages I've learned like Java. The structure is generally easier to understand as there isn't as much code needed to be written.



2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
   Python, Java, and Javascript have simliar code, besides the fact that Python is shorter and simpler than them in terms of the code needed to write. One difference worth mentioning between Python and Java, is that python doesn't use semi-colons to close a statement.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
   I learned the overall structure of python thorugh solving problems that were similiar to what I would solve in Java to give me a stronger understanding on how they compare when it comes to these kind of problems.
